There are a couple of terms that are central to understanding this.</p><p>You first need to have templates, which is the HTML code for your pages. This is styled with CSS in one or more style sheets that are attached to each template. You then create pages that contain your websites content using one of these templates.</p><p>That doesn\'t sound too hard, does it? Basically you don\'t need to know any HTML or CSS to get a site up with CMS Made Simple. But if you want to customize it to your liking, consider learning some <a class="external" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a>.</p><p>In the menu to the left you can read more about this, as well as more advanced features like the Menu Manager, additional extensions for adding many kinds of functionality to your site and the Event Manager for managing work flow.

Whatever is in a template is used on every  page that uses that template, meaning that the person editing the content  doesn\'t need any web design skills.</p><p>In the template there are placeholders for content and navigation areas. When  a user is visiting your site the page is automatically generated from the  template and the placeholders are filled with the content.</p><p>The template is the HTML structure. It is then styled in one or more  <em>style sheets</em> that are attached to each template. This styling is done  with CSS. So to get a site look the way you want you should be familiar with HTML and CSS on at least a basic level. But don\'t worry, there are themes with  ready-made templates and style sheets for you to download!</p><p>When you first install CMS Made Simple there are some basic templates that  you can use and customize to your needs. Those templates are described in the section {cms_selflink page=default_templates text=\'Default Templates Explained\'}. The designer of your site can also add new templates to make the site look any way you want.

Think of a web-site as a set  of pages. These pages are accessed through a menu. You can also link to a page  from within another page.</p><h3>Navigation/Menu</h3><p>The navigation, or the menu, is a set of links that help the user to navigate through  the pages on your web site. These links are automatically created by CMS Made  Simple from the page structure. This hierarchy is what drives the menu you see  on the left of this page.</p><p>Pages can be in several levels, like a tree of generations. The top level in  the menu are the parent pages. Each parent page can have children pages, which  in turn can be parents to other children.</p><p>The page template determines where on a page the navigation is placed.</p><p>You can create any kind of navigation you can dream of by customizing a menu  template for <em>Menu Manager</em>. However, the default templates should work  for most situations as the menu basically is just an unordered list that you  style to your liking with CSS.

When you add content to a page, it is automatically  placed in the placeholders of the template selected for that page.</p><p>A template can define one or several content areas, or content blocks. To add more content blocks to your template, use <code>{ldelim}content block=\'block name\'}</code>. These blocks will then appear as text areas when you edit or add a page that uses that template.</p><p>You can make a content block use only one line, instead of a full text area, by using the parameter oneline=true. That is, the full tag being: <code>{ldelim}content block=\'block name\' oneline=true}</code>. Read about more parameters in the help for the Content tag in the CMSMS Admin Panel, under Extensions &raquo; Tags.</p><h3>Content Types</h3><p>There are currently 6 main content types in version {cms_version} "{cms_versionname}". These content types determine the type of content for each menu item.</p><ul><li>Content</li><li>Error Page</li><li>External Page Link</li><li>Internal Page Link</li><li>Section Header</li><li>Separator</li></ul><p>The <strong>Content</strong> type is simply a regular page. Normally this is the only one you will use. That is what this page you are reading is. Here you can put any content that you would put on a regular page. The layout of these types of pages are controlled by the templates. For each <strong>content</strong> page you create you must add the title, menu text, choose if it is going to have a parent and choose a template for it.  If you login as admin and change the template of this page, you will see exactly how it works.</p><p>The <strong>Error Page</strong> type is just what it sounds like, a page you set for "404 page not found" errors, where you can add the content that shows when a 404 error occurs, a target type and title, you can also choose the template it uses, it has no parent as it is not part of the menu.</p><p>The <strong>External Page Link</strong> type is just what it sounds like, a link to another external page and you add the title, menu text, choose if it is going to have a parent and a destination page along with the target setting and other options that a content type page has. This <strong>external page link</strong> type also shows up in the menu following the same hierarchy rules as the <strong>content</strong> type.</p><p>The <strong>Internal Page Link</strong> type is also just what it sounds like, a link to another internal page. This <strong>internal page link</strong> type also shows up in the menu following the same hierarchy rules as the <strong>content</strong> type and you add the title, menu text, choose if it is going to have a parent and a destination page along with the target setting and other options that a content type page has.</p><p>The <strong>Section Header</strong> type is used to break up menus into groupings (sections). This is unrelated to the hierarchy, as the section headers have no associated pages with them but can be used to group a set of links of similar content under them. They are just a little bit of text to say what the next few links are in reference to.</p><p>The <strong>Separator</strong> type is just what it sounds like, a separator that appears on the menus. This type follows the hierarchy set in content management pages.</p>', NULL, '2017-03-24 14:33:37') ;

They are designed to accomplish just one small and specific task.</p><p>There are a number of custom tags available with CMS Made Simple. To find what kind of tags are available look in Extensions &raquo; Tags in the Admin Panel.</p><p>To insert any of these in a template or a page, simply type e.g. <code>{ldelim}content}</code>. Many of these Smarty tags are used as placeholders in a template, i.e. placeholders for content, navigation, breadcrumbs etc.</p><p>Website developers who have a bit of PHP experience will find it easy to create and share their own custom tags.</p><h3>User defined tags</h3><p>Users can also create their own tags to insert in templates or pages., these are called user defined tags. They are snippets of php code (but without the &lt;?php and ?&gt; surrounding them), providing the ability to add re-usable pieces of php functionality to your site. User defined tags are inserted in templates and pages just like tags: <code>{ldelim}tagname}</code>.</p><p>Typically, user defined tags provide a utility that is special to a website, and likely won\'t need to be re-used on another site. Also they are typically small and used for simple tasks.</p><h3>Modules</h3><p>Modules are the highest level of plugin in the CMS Made Simple environment. They are designed to allow developers to implement complex tasks within CMSMS. A module typically provides advanced functionality, usually interacts with the database in complex ways, and may provide numerous reports or forms on the website. Additionally, a module may have an administrative interface to allow manipulating its data and its settings.</p><p>An extremely well defined API <em>(Application Programming Interface)</em> has been written to allow module developers to write complex, intricate, and fully functioning applications for use within a CMSMS powered website.</p><p>There are {cms_selflink page=\'modules\' text=\'a few modules included\'} with the default installation of CMS Made Simple. Other popular modules are Frontend Users, Album, Calendar, Guestbook and Form Builder.</p><p>The ModuleManager module (included with CMS Made Simple) allows browsing a list of available modules, reading about them, and then installing them on your website.</p><p>To insert modules in a template or a page, you actually use the module name as a parameter to the <code>{ldelim}cms_module}</code> tag. It looks like this: <code>{ldelim}cms_module module=\'modulename\' parameter1=\'this\' parameter2=5 parameter3=\'that\'}</code>. It is normal for modules to accept parameters to effect changes to their default behavior, though it is not always required.</p><h3>Read more</h3><p>You can read more about extensions in the <a class="external" href="http://docs.cmsmadesimple.org/modules/add-ons">CMSMS documentation</a>.</p>', NULL, '2017-03-24 14:33:37') ;

Make sure that grid columns\r\n	 * are wrapped inside a element with .row class.\r\n	 * When grid columns are inside a row element, floats are auto cleared,\r\n	 * therefore you do not need anything like some empty clear element ie. <div class="clear"></div>\r\n	 * Grid columns have a spacing (margin-left) of 3.8% of the layout, whereby first column after\r\n	 * .row opening element will have no spacing (margin-left).\r\n	 * Grid columns are only applied to Browser and Screen size which are greater then 768px;\r\n	 * \r\n	 * Example (three column row):\r\n	 * \r\n	 * <!-- container has a preset padding to left and right with 20px -->\r\n	 * <div class="container">\r\n	 *     <!-- clears floating row of columns, sets maximum width of 1440px -->\r\n	 *     <div class="row
